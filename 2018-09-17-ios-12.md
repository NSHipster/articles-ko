이번 WWDC 키노트를 들으셨다면 iOS 12의 큰 기능들은 이미 알고계실 것입니다. [Siri Shortcuts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sirikit#2979425), [ARKit 2](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/), [Core ML 2](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/) 그리고 오랜기간 루머였던 iOS/Mac을 연결하는 "Marzipan"은 말 할 것도 없겠죠.

그리고 이번에 [Platforms State of the Union 세션](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/102/)을 보셨다면 화려하진 않지만 충분히 흥미로운 새로운 기술인 [커스터마이징 가능한 노티피케이션 UI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotificationsui/)와 [Natural Language](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage) 프레임워크를 보셨을 것입니다.

하지만 우리 NSHipster는 더욱 더 핵심적인 기술을 좋아합니다. 작은 변경일지라도 그것이 우리의 매일매일에 큰 파급력을 가져오는 그런 기술요.
이번 [iOS 12 릴리즈 노트](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios_release_notes/ios_12_release_notes)와 [Foundation 릴리즈 노트](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios_release_notes/ios_12_release_notes/foundation_release_notes)에는 사람들에게 알려지지 않은 새로운 변경들이 많습니다.

iOS 12의 릴리즈를 축하하는 의미로 저희는 [iOS 11.4와 12의 API 변경](http://codeworkshop.net/objc-diff/sdkdiffs/ios/12.0/)에 대해 알아낸 것들을 공유하고자 합니다.
(이 중 상당수는 아직 문서화되지 않은 것도 있으니 신중하게 진행하세요!)

## 중요한 리퀘스트를 위한 네트워크 트래픽 우선 순위 변경

iOS를 위한 Fast Lane을 들어보신 적 있으신가요?
그 [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) 아니고, 그 [IOS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/ios-nx-os-software/ios-technologies/index.html)도 아닙니다.

[Fast Lane](https://developer.cisco.com/site/fast-lane/) (혹은 [Fastlane](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/technotes/8-3/Optimizing_WiFi_Connectivity_and_Prioritizing_Business_Apps.pdf) 인가요?) 은 무선 트래픽을 종류(오디오, 비디오, 백그라운드 데이터)에 맞게 우선 순위를 변경해주는 메커니즘입니다.
이는 Cisco 라우터에서만 사용가능한 기술인데, 빠른 로밍을 위한 [802.11r](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11r-2008), 보조 로밍을 위한 [802.11k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11k-2008) 그리고 무선 설정을 위한 [802.11v](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11v)와 같은 여러 Wi-Fi 표준을 하나로 묶습니다.

[2015년에 발표된](https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&articleId=1715414) Apple과 Cisco 사이의 파트너쉽 덕분에 iOS 개발자들은 [서비스 종류(QoS 마킹)](https://developer.cisco.com/site/fast-lane/)를 네트워크 커넥션에 제공하는 것만으로 이 기술을 넣을 수 있게 되었습니다. (이미 많은 고급 API가 자동으로 이를 처리하고 있습니다)

iOS 12에서 새로 나온 `URLRequest` 객체는 `networkServiceType` 을 [`NSURLNetworkServiceTypeResponsiveData`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlrequestnetworkservicetype/nsurlnetworkservicetyperesponsivedata?language=objc)로 설정해서 시간에 예민한 리퀘스트의 우선 순위를 변경할 수 있습니다.

```swift
import Foundation

let url = URL(string: "https://example.com/checkout")!
var request = URLRequest(url: url)
request.httpMethod = "POST"
request.networkServiceType = .responsiveData // Prioritize

URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) {
    (data, response, error) in
    // ...
}
```

이 옵션은 현재 문서화돼있지는 않지만 [WWDC 2018 Session 714: "Optimizing Your App for Today’s Internet"](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/714/)에서 엔지니어는 이 기술을 현명하게 꼭 필요할 때만 사용하라고 말했습니다. 그들이 제시한 예제는 "쇼핑 앱의 체크아웃 페이지" 였지만 또 다른 잠재적인 사용 케이스를 추론할 수 있을 것입니다.

## 백그라운드에서 NFC 태그 읽기


One of the longstanding questions coming out of WWDC 2018 was the new [`ndefMessagePayload`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity/2968463-ndefmessagepayload) property added to `NSUserActivity`.
At the time, the most that Apple engineers would offer during Lab sessions was "no comment".


But all became clear with last week's announcements of the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR.
These devices support reading NFC tags in the background, and if you're running iOS 12 on the latest generation of devices, you'll be able to ---
among other things --- launch apps, start calls, and open URLs in response to scanning compatible NFC tags.
No additional setup required.
To avoid inadvertent activation, this only works if the iPhone is unlocked and not currently in Airplane Mode or being used for Apple Pay or camera.


With this NFC integration, Apple hopes to fully realize past promises made about <abbr title="Bluetooth Low Energy">BLE</abbr> iBeacons back in 2013, offering a sleeker interface to the real world than the depravity of scanning a QR code (a practice ubiquitous in China, but largely ignored to the rest of the world).


Perhaps the most commonly advertised use cases for both technologies NFC and iBeacon technologies have been visiting a museum and getting additional details about an exhibit by hovering your phone near a strategically-placed information placard.


Enabling this kind of functionality in your app requires entitlements, setting associated domains, and other configuration --- not to mention the actual APIs you need to implement.
Fortunately, Apple provides some extensive documentation for this process, including [this sample code project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc/building_an_nfc_tag_reader_app?changes=latest_minor) and [this article](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc/adding_support_for_background_tag_reading?changes=latest_minor).


## Matching Contacts on Phone Number and Email Address


The [Contacts framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/contacts) was introduced in iOS 9 and macOS El Capitan as a modern replacement for the [AddressBook framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/addressbook).


Until recently, you could only search for contacts by name and identifier. With iOS 12, you can now use the [`predicateForContacts(matching:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/contacts/cncontact/3020511-predicateforcontacts), and [`predicateForContacts(matchingEmailAddress:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/contacts/cncontact/3020510-predicateforcontacts) class methods on `CNContact` to construct predicates for matching on phone numbers and email addresses.


For example, if we wanted to retrieve the given and family name components for all contacts with a given phone number and email address, you create a `CNContactFetchRequest`, specify a compound "AND" predicate created from the individual subpredicates, and pass that to the `enumerateContacts(with:)` method called on the current `CNContactStore`:

```swift
import Contacts

let phoneNumber = CNPhoneNumber(stringValue: "+1 555 555 1234")
let phoneNumberPredicate = CNContact.predicateForContacts(matching: phoneNumber)

let emailPredicate = CNContact.predicateForContacts(matchingEmailAddress: "johnny@example.com")

var fetchRequest = CNContactFetchRequest(keysToFetch: [
    CNContactGivenNameKey as CNKeyDescriptor,
    CNContactFamilyNameKey as CNKeyDescriptor
])

fetchRequest.predicate =
  NSCompoundPredicate(andPredicateWithSubpredicates: [
    phoneNumberPredicate,
    emailPredicate
])

let store = CNContactStore()
try store.enumerateContacts(with: fetchRequest) { (contact, _) in
    // ...
}
```


## Updating Location While Airborne


iPads are especially popular among pilots, who use them for navigation and flight planning.
If you're working on an app geared for folks up in the cockpit, you'll be delighted to hear that `CLLocationManager` now has something just for you in iOS 12.


The [`activityType` property](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/1620567-activitytype) has been around for a while, but remains a lesser-known configuration option for `CLLocationManager`.
If you use a location manager to track changes in position over time, a quick "low-hanging fruit" optimization is to specify how you expect users to be perambulating.
Until now, these modes of transportation have been strictly terrestrial: [automotive](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clactivitytype/automotivenavigation), [walking / running / biking](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clactivitytype/fitness), [what have you](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clactivitytype/other).
But in iOS 12, you can specify the [airborne activity type](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clactivitytype/clactivitytypeairborne?language=objc) and let your app's motion tracking algorithms soar!

```swift
import CoreLocation

let manager = CLLocationManager()
manager.activityType = .airborne // ✈️
```


## Detecting Flat Device Orientation


Have you ever wanted to determine whether an iOS device was laying flat on a surface, but were loath to do _two_ equality checks in the process? Good news!
In iOS 12, there's a new convenience property: `isFlat`.

```swift
import UIKit

// iOS 12+
UIDevice.current.orientation.isFlat

// iOS <= 11.4
UIDevice.current.orientation == .faceUp ||
  UIDevice.current.orientation == .faceDown
```


## Auto-filling New Passwords and One-Time Codes in Text Fields


Apple goes to heroic lengths to make user input pleasant on iOS devices.
Yet despite their best efforts, the fact remains: the experience of typing on a featureless piece of smooth glass is always going to pale in comparison to a proper hardware keyboard (discontentment about the latest MacBook models notwithstanding).


To minimize the amount of text-entry drudgery, iOS 10 introduced the [`textContentType`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextcontenttype) property for controls conforming to the `UITextInputTraits` protocol --- namely `UITextField` and `UITextView`.
By providing one of the enumeration values you declare the semantic value of the control, which allows for details like certain name and address components to be auto-filled based on the current user's information.


iOS 12 and tvOS 12 expand on this by adding two new content types: [`UITextContentTypeNewPassword`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextcontenttype/2980929-newpassword) and [`UITextContentTypeOneTimeCode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextcontenttype/2980930-onetimecode).


When you specify the `.newPassword` content type in conjunction with [the `passwordRules` property ](https://nshipster.com/uitextinputpasswordrules/), Password AutoFill can automatically generate new passwords according to the login requirements of the system.

```swift
textField.textContentType = .newPassword
textField.passwordRules = .init(descriptor:
    "allowed: ascii-printable; minlength: 8;"
)
```


When you specify the `.oneTimeCode` content type, the text field can automatically forward two-factor authentication codes received via SMS.

```swift
textField.textContentType = .oneTimeCode
```

---


That wraps up this round of iOS 12 diff spelunking.
Of course, this is an enormous release, so we look forward to cover many more new APIs in greater depth in the weeks to come.
